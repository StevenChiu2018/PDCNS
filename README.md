# Private Data Collection using Negative Surveys

## Abstract
When we do a survey, we must fill in our personal information. If  the host leaks surveys, we have no chance to stop our personal  information from being on the market. To prevent this, the paper Enhancing Privacy in Participatory Sensing Applications with  Multidimensional Data[1] proposed that we can do negative surveys and reconstruct the original distribution from disguised data in the base station. This paper will implement the paper on estimating the prevalence of diseases in five cities in Arizona. This survey collects one million responses. I will answer two questions in this paper from those surveys. The first one is the prevalence of sexual diseases in this community. The second one is which city has the most diagnosed with herpes. In addition, I will analyze this method by calculating utility and privacy metrics.
